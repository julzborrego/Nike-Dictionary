For the espresso test I wrote a simple test just checking widgets were displayed and with the correct texts. Had I had more time i would have like to add a mock web server or implement idling resources to test query functions. Also, the functions in TestingUtils were taken from the web as they are experimental and not part of the coroutine/live data testing library yet.
